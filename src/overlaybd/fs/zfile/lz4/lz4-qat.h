/*! LZ4_compress_qat() :
    Compresses 'srcSize' bytes from buffer 'src'
    into already allocated 'dst' buffer of size 'dstCapacity'.
    Compression is guaranteed to succeed if 'dstCapacity' >= LZ4_compressBound(srcSize).
    It also runs faster, so it's a recommended setting.
    If the function cannot compress 'src' into a more limited 'dst' budget,
    compression stops *immediately*, and the function result is zero.
    Note : as a consequence, 'dst' content is not valid.
    Note 2 : This function is protected against buffer overflow scenarios (never writes outside
   'dst' buffer, nor read outside 'source' buffer). srcSize : max supported value is
   LZ4_MAX_INPUT_SIZE. dstCapacity : size of buffer 'dst' (which must be already allocated) return
   : the number of bytes written into buffer 'dst' (necessarily <= dstCapacity)
                  or 0 if compression fails */
